# Lab Report 4

## Step 1: Logging onto ieng6. 
Using an ssh key, I was able to log onto ieng6 simply by typing and entering `ssh cs15lwi23aux@ieng.ucsd.edu` without using my password.

The ssh key was made by following these steps:

## Step 2: Cloning the fork of the repository from my Github account

I first forked the lab7 repository by clicking the fork button.

Then I typed and entered `git clone <link of repo>` into the terminal to clone the repository to ieng6.

## Step 3: Checking that the JUNIT tests fail

In order to run the JUNIT tests, I had to first change directories to lab77 by entering `cd l` and then pressing `tab` to autocomplete to the lab7 directory.

To find the file to be tested, I used `ls`, which listed all of the files in the lab7 directory.

Next, I copied `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` and `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <Test file>` from the week 3 lab manual and ran them in the terminal sequentially. For the second command I typed `L` then pressed `tab`, then typed `T`, then pressed `tab` again in order to autocomplete to ListExamples.Test. Then I hit enter in order to run the tests.

## Step 4: Editing the code 

To edit `ListExamples.java` and fix its code, I type `nano L` then `tab` then `.j` then `tab` to autocomplete to ListExamples.java. I entered this to edit the file.
This was the UI that came up.

The problem with the file was that the code was iterating the index of the first list when it should have been iterating the index of the second one. In order to edit the error, I pressed the `down` key 43 times until I reached the line which had `index1 +=1` (The second occurence of that line) Then I pressed the `right` key 12 times until my cursor was right after the `1`. I then deleted the 1 and replaced it with a `2`.

To save the changes, I used `ctrl + O` and then `enter`, and I exited nano by using `ctrl + X`.

Now I am back in the terminal

## Step 5 Running the new code

To run the new code against the JUNIT tests, I simply pressed the the `up` key 3 times to find my previous compile command. I then hit enter to recompile the files.

Then I pressed `up` 3 times again to find my previous JUNIT running command. Then I pressed enter to run the tests. We see that the tests all pass now.

## Step 6 Committing and Pushing the change to Github

Before starting this step, I had to first make an SSH Key for github by following these steps:

Then I had to change my push protocal to ssh protocal by entering `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:AndyZng/lab7.git`

Now I was ready to stage the changes by using `git add <File Name>` This was followed by using `git commit -m "<message>"` to actually commit the changes.

Finally I pushed my changes to Github by using `git push`

We can see that the repository has been updated on Github.
